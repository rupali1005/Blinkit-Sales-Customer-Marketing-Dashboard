Power BI dashboard analyzing Blinkit’s Sales, Customer, Marketing, and Feedback data to uncover key business insights and improve decision-making.

# 📊 Blinkit Sales, Customer & Marketing Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI project showcases an end-to-end analysis of Blinkit’s operations across Sales, Customers, Marketing, and Feedback.

The goal was to design an interactive dashboard that not only tracks KPIs but also highlights actionable business insights, such as revenue trends, customer growth, marketing ROI, and sentiment patterns.




By building this project, I aimed to demonstrate how data visualization and DAX calculations can transform raw business data into meaningful insights that support decision-making.
